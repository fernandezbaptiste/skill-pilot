# Init Playwright CLI

Verify that `playwright-cli`, Chrome, and the Playwright MCP Bridge extension are ready
before any browser automation is attempted.

## When to Use This Skill

- Any task that requires browser automation via playwright-cli
- playwright-cli may not be installed or Chrome may be missing
- The MCP Bridge extension may not be active

## Your Roles in This Skill

- **SysOps Engineer**: Install and validate playwright-cli and Chrome
- **QA Engineer**: Confirm the browser extension bridge is active end-to-end

## Role Communication

As an expert in your assigned roles, you must announce your actions before performing them using the following format:

As a {Role, and Role-XYZ if you have more roles}, I will {action description}

## Other Agent Skills Required

- `key-safe`
- `playwright-cli`

## Workflow Usage Requirement

When this skill is used in a workflow agent node:

- Output result as plain text. If the user asked to save it to a file, write it there.
- Include concise context in the output (what was checked, what is ready, and any blocking issue) so downstream agents can safely continue.

## Instructions

### Step 1: Check if playwright-cli is installed

```bash
playwright-cli --version
```

If the command is not found:

```bash
pnpm install -g @playwright/cli@latest
playwright-cli --version
```

### Step 2: Test browser + extension bridge

```bash
playwright-cli open --extension --headed
```

Treat this as an **initialization flow**, not a blocking foreground command:

- Start it in a background process.
- Do **not** wait for the command to sit there until timeout.
- This init command is only for extension setup. Once setup is complete, normal browser automation should use direct commands such as `playwright-cli open --extension --headed`.

Interpret the result as follows:

- If it returns quickly with `Browser \`default\` opened with pid ...`, the browser bridge is ready.
- If it returns within about 10 seconds with `Extension connection timeout. Make sure the "Playwright MCP Bridge" extension is installed.`, go to Step 3 and instruct the user to install the Chrome extension.
- If it stays open for more than about 10 seconds with no return, assume the browser is waiting for permission and is showing the extension token page. Go to Step 3 and instruct the user to copy-paste the `PLAYWRIGHT_MCP_EXTENSION_TOKEN` value.
- If you get an error that Chrome is not installed, then go to Step 3 to install Google Chrome.

### Step 3: Check any errors

**If you get an error that Chrome is not installed**

```bash
pnpm exec playwright install chrome # install the official branded Google Chrome browser
```

Once Chrome is installed, go to Step 2 and test the browser + extension bridge.

**If the Chrome extension is not installed:**

Ask the user to open Chrome and install the **Playwright MCP Bridge** extension using the URL below:
```
https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/playwright-mcp-bridge/mmlmfjhmonkocbjadbfplnigmagldckm
```

Ask the user to confirm once the installation is complete, then go to Step 2 and test the browser + extension bridge.

If the extension is ready and waiting for authentication, give the user two options:

1. Ask the user to copy and paste the token, then save it for automatic authentication.
2. Ask the user to click the connect button for one-time approval.

The token format shown on the Chrome extension screen is:
```bash
PLAYWRIGHT_MCP_EXTENSION_TOKEN=xxxxxxxx_xxxxxxx_xxx_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
```

If the user provides a token, kill the background `playwright-cli open --extension --headed` process, then verify it without saving anything:

```bash
PLAYWRIGHT_MCP_EXTENSION_TOKEN=token-string playwright-cli open --extension --headed
```

The verification is successful only if the command responds immediately with text like:

```text
Browser `default` opened with pid 44554.
```

If verification succeeds, use the `key-safe` skill to save `PLAYWRIGHT_MCP_EXTENSION_TOKEN` into `config/.env`.

Otherwise, the command will return `Extension connection timeout. Make sure the "Playwright MCP Bridge" extension is installed.`, but the user sees `Invalid token provided` in the web browser.

In this case, ask the user to check the web browser if it shows the message `Invalid token provided`.

If it is showing `Invalid token provided`, issue another command without the token:

```bash
playwright-cli open --extension --headed
```

Then tell the user the token is invalid and ask for a new token.

If the user does not want to paste a token, tell them they can manually approve the extension each time browser automation starts. 

Or the user can set the `PLAYWRIGHT_MCP_EXTENSION_TOKEN` token in `config/.env` manually, then restart the service with the shell command `core/bin/tool-cli engine-reload`, and refresh the webui to restart the task afterward.

Until the command below gets the correct response, then go to Step 4.

```bash
PLAYWRIGHT_MCP_EXTENSION_TOKEN=token-string playwright-cli open --extension --headed
```

### Step 4: Report result of the browser opened

```bash
playwright-cli list
```

The output should be:

```markdown
### Browsers
- default:
  - status: open
  - browser-type: chrome
  - user-data-dir: <in-memory>
  - headed: true
```

Output result as plain text, say "Default Google Chrome has been opened and is ready to use. Open any web URL using: `playwright-cli goto URL` by agent skill `playwright-cli`." If the user asked to save it to a file, write it there.

## Output

Plain text result shown to user (example):

```
Playwright CLI: ready
Chrome: Opened and ready to use
MCP Bridge extension: connected
Token setup: verified and saved with key-safe, or manual approval required
Open any web URL using: `playwright-cli goto URL` by agent skill `playwright-cli`
```

If the user requested file output, write the same content to the specified path.

## Common Issues

- **pnpm not found**: use `npm install -g @playwright/cli@latest` instead
- **Extension keeps timing out**: ensure the MCP Bridge extension is enabled in Chrome and not paused
- **No token provided**: browser automation can still work, but the user may need to manually approve the extension each time
- **Chrome opens but page doesn't load**: check network connectivity
