description: Manage LLM security key protection for config/.env using core/bin/keys-safe-guard actions (enable, disable, get_key_names, put_key_values). Supports native GUI elevation for desktop sessions and clear fallback behavior for Python/background calls when safe guard is enabled.

# AI Builder - Key Safe

Manage secure key operations for `config/.env` using the project key safe command set.

## When to Use This Skill

- User asks to enable or disable env key safeguarding
- User asks to list available key names without exposing key values
- User asks to update or insert one or more env keys safely
- User asks for secure key operations related to LLM/provider credentials
- User asks to use a GUI popup / dialog for the sudo password prompt
- A Python or background process needs to read or write protected env keys

## Your Roles in This Skill

- **Security Engineer**: Enforce safe key handling and least-privilege behavior
- **Backend Developer (Engineer)**: Run key-safe command actions correctly
- **Technical Writer**: Report exactly what changed without leaking secret values

## Role Communication

As an expert in your assigned roles, you must announce your actions before performing them using the following format:

As a {Role, and Role-XYZ if have more roles}, I will {action description}

This communication pattern ensures transparency and allows for human-in-the-loop oversight at key decision points.

## Instructions

Follow these steps in order:

### Step 1: Identify requested key-safe action

Map user intent to one action:

1. `enable` (default)
2. `disable`
3. `get_key_names`
4. `put_key_values`

### Step 2: Always use GUI mode for agent-invoked commands

Default rule: if an AI agent invokes `core/bin/keys-safe-guard`, include `--gui` on every command unless the action is `get_key_names`.

Use this rule even when the user does not explicitly mention GUI mode. Do not wait for the user to ask for a popup or dialog.

Why:
- AI agents should not depend on terminal password entry
- GUI auth avoids hanging background or non-interactive runs
- The project standard for this skill is to prefer native OS elevation dialogs whenever elevation might be needed

`--gui` forces a native OS auth dialog for privilege elevation:
- **macOS**: system admin dialog via `osascript`
- **Linux**: `pkexec` (polkit) dialog, or `sudo -A` with `zenity`/`kdialog` askpass
- **No fallback**: if GUI is unavailable (SSH session, no display, dialog cancelled), the command fails instead of hanging on terminal `sudo`

`--gui` can be placed before or after the action name.

Action rules:

- `enable`: always run with `--gui`
- `disable`: always run with `--gui`
- `put_key_values`: always run with `--gui`
- `get_key_names`: may omit `--gui` because it is read-only and the flag has no effect

Important runtime behavior when safe guard is enabled and elevation is required:

- Interactive terminal session:
  - if the AI agent follows this skill and passes `--gui`, the command uses the native GUI auth dialog
  - if a human runs the command manually without `--gui`, it may fall back to terminal `sudo`
- Python/background process with a desktop GUI session:
  - `core/bin/keys-safe-guard ...` automatically opens a native GUI permission dialog, even without `--gui`
- Python/background process without a desktop GUI session:
  - the command cannot ask for a password interactively
  - tell the user to either configure passwordless sudo for the machine or disable safe guard first

### Step 3: Execute only the required action

From repo root, run:

```bash
core/bin/keys-safe-guard --gui enable
```

```bash
core/bin/keys-safe-guard --gui disable
```

```bash
core/bin/keys-safe-guard get_key_names
```

```bash
core/bin/keys-safe-guard --gui put_key_values KEY1=VALUE1 KEY2=VALUE2
```

Use exactly one action per user request unless the user explicitly asks for a sequence.

Note: `get_key_names` reads from engine memory and does not require elevated privileges, so `--gui` is optional and has no effect for that action.

### Step 4: Prevent secret leakage

- Never print key values in summaries
- For `get_key_names`, return names only
- For `put_key_values`, report which keys were updated, not their values

### Step 5: Report result and next state

Return:

1. Action executed
2. Success/failure status
3. Non-sensitive output summary
4. Any required next step (for example engine restart after safeguard changes)

## Expected Output

- Correct key-safe action execution
- No secret value disclosure
- Clear status message with concise next steps

## Key Principles

- Prefer minimal changes and single-action execution
- Keep secrets out of logs and responses
- Use `get_key_names` for inspection whenever values are not required
- Follow user constraints about password-prompting commands
- If an AI agent invokes `core/bin/keys-safe-guard`, treat `--gui` as mandatory for every action except `get_key_names`
- Do not rely on terminal password prompts for agent-driven `enable`, `disable`, or `put_key_values`
- In a non-GUI environment, do not keep retrying GUI mode; tell the user they need passwordless sudo or need to disable safe guard from an interactive GUI-capable session first
- If a protected key operation must run without a GUI and without a terminal, do not keep retrying; tell the user to set passwordless sudo or disable safe guard
