# Vibe Coding

## Brief

Project-oriented coding workspace for creating projects, capturing change requests, and running implementation skills or workflows against project files.

## User Value

- Keeps coding requests, updates, issues, and implementation steps inside one project folder.
- Makes the project lifecycle explicit from refine through deploy.
- Supports mixed file types, not just markdown.

## Main Behavior

- Creates a new project folder and project requirement file.
- Creates update requests and issue reports inside an existing project.
- Opens files for editing or media preview depending on type.
- Exposes action buttons such as `Refine`, `Initial`, `Plan`, `Implement`, `Review`, `Test`, `Deploy`, `Update Code`, and `Fix Issues`.
- Runs either a selected skill or a selected workflow against the current instruction file.
